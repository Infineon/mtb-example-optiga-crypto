- [PSOC&trade; 62S2 Pioneer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s2-43012/) in combination with [OPTIGA&trade; Trust Adapter](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/optiga-trust-adapter/) (`CY8CKIT-062S2-43012`)

To use this code example on different hardware, follow this [guide](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Blogs/Interfacing-OPTIGA-Trust-M-with-a-PSOC-6-device/ba-p/361647).
To use kits which are based on the [OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Express](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/trust-m-express-shield/) or [OPTIGA&trade; Trust M MTR](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/trust-m-mtr-shield/) Shields, read the [Enabling the Shielded Connection](#enabling-the-shielded-connection) Section carefully.


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration for all the supported kits except [CY8CKIT-062S2-43012](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s2-43012/). This kit requires the [OPTIGA&trade; Trust Adapter](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/optiga-trust-adapter/) and any OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Shield (e.g. [OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Express](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/trust-m-express-shield/) or [OPTIGA&trade; Trust M MTR](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/trust-m-mtr-shield/)) to be plugged on it. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).


## Enabling the shielded connection

By default, the shielded connection (encrypted communication over I2C) is disabled to improve the out-of-the-box experience.
However, the security of some examples would benefit from having the shielded connection enabled.

The shielded connection requires a shared "Platform Binding Secret" (PBS) on the Host MCU and the OPTIGA&trade; Trust M, which will be used for a session-based key-derivation and following encryption of the I2C. [Read more here](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Knowledge-Base-Articles/OPTIGA-Trust-M-Shielded-connection/ta-p/354380)

The shielded connection can be enabled by uncommenting the macro `#define OPTIGA_COMMS_SHIELDED_CONNECTION` in *optiga_lib_config_mtb.h*.

The OPTIGA&trade; Trust M (v3) comes without a pre-provisioned PBS, meaning it can generate one at runtime and work out-of-the-box with this example.

[OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Express](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/trust-m-express-shield/) and [OPTIGA&trade; Trust M MTR](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/trust-m-mtr-shield/) come with a pre-provisioned PBS. This PBS must also be known to the host if the shielded connection will be used. If you want to use it in combination with OPTIGA&trade; Trust M Express or MTR chips, remember to set the matching secret `uint8_t optiga_platform_binding_shared_secret` in *COMPONENT_OPTIGA_CYHAL/pal_os_datastore.c*. If some examples report a failure with error code `0x0107` this is due to a non-matching PBS on the host and OPTIGA&trade; Trust M.


## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-optiga-crypto](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-optiga-crypto)" application with the desired name "OptigaCrypto" configured for the *CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYSBSYSKIT-DEV-01 --app-id mtb-example-optiga-crypto --user-app-name OptigaCrypto --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the following examples are displayed on the UART terminal.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

This example initializes the OPTIGA&trade; Trust device by calling a dedicated function from the Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL). This function initializes all hardware- and system-relevant components. Afterwards, the example sequentially calls isolated sub-examples to showcase various API combinations.

All examples follow the same pattern `init` function, `do_crypto` function, and an optional `deinit` function. The following snippets provide an overview:

```c
void example_main(void)
{
   uint8_t random_data_buffer [32];
   optiga_crypt_t * me_crypt_instance = NULL;
   optiga_lib_status_t return_status = !OPTIGA_LIB_SUCCESS;

   do
   {
      /*
      * Step 1. Initialize the OPTIGA device
      */
      example_optiga_init();

      /*
      * Step 2. Create an instance of optiga_crypt to perform any crypto operation on the OPTIGA device.
      */
      me_crypt_instance = optiga_crypt_create(0, optiga_lib_callback, NULL);
      if (NULL == me_crypt_instance)
      {
            break;
      }

      /*
      * Step 3..n-1. Perform any operation with the OPTIGA device; e.g., get a true random number.
      * random_data_buffer should contain the resulting random number.
      */
      optiga_lib_status = OPTIGA_LIB_BUSY;
      return_status = optiga_crypt_random(me_crypt_instance,
                                          OPTIGA_RNG_TYPE_TRNG,
                                          random_data_buffer,
                                          sizeof(random_data_buffer));

      WAIT_AND_CHECK_STATUS(return_status, optiga_lib_status);

      /* Step n. De-initialize the OPTIGA device. This step is optional in many cases because some resources on MCU-based systems cannot be de-initialized.
      */
      example_optiga_deinit();
   } while (FALSE);
}
```

OPTIGA&trade; `init` and `deinit` functions simply allocate a new command context and send an `OpenApplication` command to the chip. The `while` loop is required to synchronize the state machine. The application is free to implement this differently and check the status occasionally; the rest might be in an idle state.

```c
#include "optiga/optiga_crypt.h"
#include "optiga/optiga_util.h"
#include "optiga/optiga_lib_config.h"


optiga_util_t * me_util_instance = NULL;
optiga_crypt_t * me_crypt_instance = NULL;

/**

static volatile optiga_lib_status_t optiga_lib_status;
//lint --e{818} suppress "argument "context" is not used in the sample provided"
static void optiga_lib_callback(void * context, optiga_lib_status_t return_status)
{
   optiga_lib_status = return_status;
   if (NULL != context)
   {
      // callback to upper layer here
   }
}

// Check return status
#define WAIT_AND_CHECK_STATUS(return_status, optiga_lib_status)\
                            if (OPTIGA_LIB_SUCCESS != return_status)\
                            {\
                                break;\

                            {\
                                return_status = optiga_lib_status;\
                                break;\
                            }

void example_optiga_init(void)
{
    optiga_lib_status_t return_status = !OPTIGA_LIB_SUCCESS;

           if (NULL == me_util_instance)

         * using the optiga_util_open_application.
         */
        optiga_lib_status = OPTIGA_LIB_BUSY;
        return_status = optiga_util_open_application(me_util_instance, 0);

        WAIT_AND_CHECK_STATUS(return_status, optiga_lib_status);

    }while(FALSE);

         * Close the application on the OPTIGA device after all the operations are executed
         * using optiga_util_close_application.
         */
        optiga_lib_status = OPTIGA_LIB_BUSY;
        return_status = optiga_util_close_application(me_util_instance, 0);

        WAIT_AND_CHECK_STATUS(return_status, optiga_lib_status);

        // Destroy util and crypt instances
        optiga_util_destroy(me_util_instance);
